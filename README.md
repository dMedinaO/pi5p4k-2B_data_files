## Abstract

### Background

Changes in salinity are a significant factor driving the distribution, community structure and functioning of organisms in marine ecosystems. Marine organisms inhabiting regions with low variability in salinity are affected when exposed to sudden salinity changes. Tolerance level depends on various molecular signalling pathways to deal with hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic stress. Chile is the largest copper producer worldwide, and extraction and production are primarily located in the region with the highest water stress (Atacama Desert). Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is one of the best alternatives to obtain freshwater for human and industrial uses. However, increased seawater salinity resulting from brine discharges can stress marine organisms. The scallop, *Argopecten purpuratus*, is a species of great economic and ecological importance in Chile, and its natural distribution occurs in regions with the highest RO use. This study determined the responses of *A. purpuratus* when exposed to brine obtained from a desalination plant with an initial concentration of 57.7 g/L in laboratory bioassays using gene expression analysis.

### Results

The results showed that *A. purpuratus* presented a wide range of tolerance to salinity changes between 34 to 57.7 g/L. We also identified an upregulation in the gene coding for the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-β kinase type II (PI5P4K-2β) as a response to hyperosmotic stress at 7 days.

### Conclusions

*A. purpuratus* responded to hypersaline stress under laboratory conditions. This study was the first to show a positive response in the expression of the PI5P4K-2β gene under hyperosmotic conditions in this species.
